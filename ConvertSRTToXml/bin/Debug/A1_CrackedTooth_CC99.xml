	 <p begin='00:00:01.250' end='00:00:04.666'>Cracked tooth syndrome is a term that describes the sensitivity </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:04.666' end='00:00:05.958'>or pain in a tooth </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:05.958' end='00:00:08.500'>caused by an incomplete fracture or crack </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:09.166' end='00:00:10.916'>You may have cracked tooth syndrome </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:10.916' end='00:00:13.916'>if you find yourself chewing only on one side of your mouth </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:14.750' end='00:00:17.333'>your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold temperatures </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:18.125' end='00:00:20.000'>you feel a sharp pain when chewing </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:20.291' end='00:00:22.916'>or your pain is intermittent rather than constant </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:23.333' end='00:00:25.458'>Your teeth endure a tremendous amount of pressure </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:25.458' end='00:00:27.291'>from biting and chewing everyday </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:27.791' end='00:00:28.833'>As teeth age  </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:28.833' end='00:00:30.750'>they may lose some of their original strength </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:31.250' end='00:00:32.958'>or when tooth structure is lost </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:33.250' end='00:00:35.750'>as with large fillings or root canal therapy </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:36.166' end='00:00:37.000'>Teeth can crack </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:37.000' end='00:00:39.625'>due to heavy stresses of clenching or grinding </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:39.916' end='00:00:42.125'>chewing on hard objects like ice </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:42.125' end='00:00:43.291'>unpopped popcorn </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:43.291' end='00:00:44.333'>hard candy </p>

	 <p begin='00:00:47.041' end='00:00:49.125'>To diagnose cracked tooth syndrome </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:49.125' end='00:00:50.958'>we will perform a thorough examination </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:50.958' end='00:00:52.083'>of your mouth and teeth </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:52.666' end='00:00:54.208'>Since tooth fractures are almost </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:54.208' end='00:00:56.375'>always invisible to the naked eye </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:56.833' end='00:00:59.416'>the exam typically involves radiographs </p>
	 <p begin='00:00:59.833' end='00:01:01.250'>However it is possible  </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:01.250' end='00:01:03.708'>that the radiographs may not reveal the crack </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:04.250' end='00:01:07.375'>so we may also analyze your bite to isolate the problem </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:07.583' end='00:01:09.333'>We may have you bite on a bite stick </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:09.333' end='00:01:11.125'>or refer you to an endodontist </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:11.666' end='00:01:13.833'>After identifying the fracture in your tooth </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:14.208' end='00:01:17.041'>the treatment will be determined based upon the location </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:17.041' end='00:01:18.125'>and direction of the crack </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:18.333' end='00:01:19.791'>and the extent of damage </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:20.375' end='00:01:23.541'>Some cracks affect only the outer enamel layer of your tooth </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:23.875' end='00:01:24.708'>in which case </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:24.708' end='00:01:26.458'>we will remove the affected portion </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:26.958' end='00:01:28.958'>The tooth is stabilized with an onlay </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:29.166' end='00:01:31.000'>protecting it from further damage </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:31.333' end='00:01:32.833'>or restored with a crown </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:33.291' end='00:01:36.208'>But if the crack affects the deeper dentin or pulp layers </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:36.208' end='00:01:38.083'>the tooth will need root canal therapy </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:38.083' end='00:01:39.833'>before a crown can be placed </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:40.333' end='00:01:41.416'>In rare cases </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:41.416' end='00:01:43.416'>the crack extends all the way  through the tooth </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:43.416' end='00:01:44.541'>and under the bone </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:44.708' end='00:01:45.791'>In these cases </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:45.791' end='00:01:47.458'>there is no way to restore the tooth </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:47.583' end='00:01:48.750'>and it must be removed </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:49.500' end='00:01:50.500'>Should this happen </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:50.500' end='00:01:52.833'>we will talk with you about replacement options </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:53.458' end='00:01:54.250'>Fortunately </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:54.250' end='00:01:56.083'>with early diagnosis and treatment </p>
	 <p begin='00:01:56.291' end='00:01:57.833'>most cracked teeth can be saved </p>
